# DTSA_5509_Supervised_Learning_Final_Project

This repository contains the codes for the final project of DTSA 5509 at University of Colorado, Boulder.
This directory contains two notebooks, model_1.ipynb and model_2.ipynb for my initial and final models.
The dataset is from a Kaggle playground series called 'Predict CO2 Emission in Rwanda'. You can find the original competition at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20.
The dataset can be found in the data tab or alternatively at  https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e20/data.
The dataset contains three files, train.csv, test.csv and sample_submission.csv. The first two contain the train and test set and the last one is a template of how we are supposed to create our predictions as a submission file.
